        <p class = "explain align-center"> Education in New York City is complicated compared to other states. The developments of specialized high schools led to the development of hundreds of prep centers throughout wealthier areas that gave an unfair advantage to the wealthy. As a resident of the Bronx where over 40% of people are below the poverty line, I see firsthand the number of disadvantaged students in the Bronx. I believe tech can be used to provide an equal access to education through free services through the internet. </p>

        <p class = "explain align-center">As a first-generation low-income college student, my family has had issues with securing stable housing in the past. Currently, there is around 80,000 homeless recorded homeless people in New York City, and this number does not include the thousands of people living off of the generosity of their friends. In the past, I developed an app called ShelterLinks, which helps homeless shelters and food pantries reach out to volunteers to support the homeless population in NYC</p>

        <h3 class = "topic"> Food Insecurity </h3>
        <p class = "explain align-center"> With over 8.6 million people in NYC, we generate a lot of waste. Paired with the fact that more than 1.2 million of the 8.6 million people (14.4%) have experienced food insecurity, tech can be used to facilitate and steamline the process of donations of unwanted food to give to food pantries or shelters. Restaurants in NYC generate half million tons of food waste every year, so this wasted food can instead be used to combat food security in order for NYC residents to focus on other aspects of their life. </p>

  <h3 class="wow bounceInUp">About Me</h3>
  <img src="./img/Me.jpg"/>
  <p>I am a first-year at Columbia University with the goal of incentivizing social change through the endless possibilities of computer science. I have worked as a web developer for several nonprofits before, but I also have experienece in Java and Python. On campus, I am on Columbia Spectator's Engineering Team where I work on products for the Columbia Community.
  Off campus, I am an intern for a startup called Instascreener that analyzes the accounts of Instagram Influencers to improve the ROI of sponsoring companies<br><br>
  Outside of Computer Science, I work to increase the number of education opportunities for underpriviledged students. In the past, I have tutored at a homeless shelter, taught web development, and gave SHSAT lessons.
