        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img src="./img/Me.jpg"/>
        <p>I am a high school student at the Bronx High School Of Science with the goal of incentivizing social change through the endless possibilities of computer science. I have experience in HTML and CSS, and I also work in Java and Python. One specific topic I am very interested in is machine learning and its capabilities. In school, I am on the Hackathon Committee to help organize AtomHacks and I am the secretary of the Bronx Science Hackers Club.<br><br>
        Besides Computer Science, I also love tutoring, so I volunteer weekly at a homeless shelter and tutor students in AP Computer Science. In addition, I love to read and hang out with my siblings.

                    <p>Children's Haven focuses on providing services to children of incarcerated parents and teaches them crucial life skills like confidence and public speaking. They offer a variety of programs including tutoring and drumming sessions. To combine my passions of tutoring and computer science, I volunteered to create the nonprofit's website. Later on, I will also help lead student volunteers to help tutor the kids. </p>
